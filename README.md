playfair.py
===========

Python implementation of the
[Playfair cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher),
an encryption technique invented in 1854.

It is code from the time I started learning programming, so please excuse the
bad style.

The `playfair.py` file contains the full implementation and a small example,
taken from the movie [National Treasure: Book of Secrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure:_Book_of_Secrets), which inspired me to start this
little project.
